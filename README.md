# NYC-Schools
A native app to provide SAT score information on NYC High Schools

To-Do:
- rename view controllers to make them simpler to understand
- add more commenting
- make the UI look nicer

Dependencies:
- I used AlamoFire and SwiftyJSON to help with JSON parsing.

Possible Bug:
- I added a splash screen first because the table view would crash because the cells would try and populate before the API call is finished.
